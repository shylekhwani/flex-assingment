        Grid and flexbox. The basic difference between CSS grid layout and CSS
        flexbox layout is that flexbox was designed for layout in one dimension
        - either a row or a column. Grid was designed for two-dimensional layout
        - rows, and columns at the same time
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Css Grid:</b>CSS Grid Layout, is a two-dimensional grid-based layout
        system with rows and columns, making it easier to design web pages
        without having to use floats and positioning. Like tables, grid layout
        allow us to align elements into columns and rows. To get started you
        have to define a container element as a grid with display: grid, set the
        column and row sizes with grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows,
        and then place its child elements into the grid with grid-column and
        grid-row.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Flexbox :</b> The CSS Flexbox offers a one-dimensional layout. It is
        helpful in allocating and aligning the space among items in a container
        (made of grids). It works with all kinds of display devices and screen
        sizes. To get started you have to define a container element as a grid
        with display: flex;
      </p>
      <b>Choosing between flexbox and Grid:</b>
      <p>
        <b>Flexbox:</b>Flexbox mostly helps align content & move blocks,Flexbox
        works better in one dimension only (either rows OR columns).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Grid:</b>CSS Grids helps you create the outer layout of the webpage.
        You can build complex as well responsive design with this. This is why
        it is called 'layout first',CSS grids are for 2D layouts. It works with
        both rows and columns.

        <b>Justify-content:</b>This defines the alignment along the main axis.
        It helps distribute extra free space leftover when either all the flex
        items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their
        maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items
        when they overflow the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Align-items:</b>This defines the default behavior for how flex items
        are laid out along the cross axis on the current line. Think of it as
        the justify-content version for the cross-axis (perpendicular to the
        main-axis).
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Flex-direction:</b>This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the
        direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside
        from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex
        items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical
        columns.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Flex-Wrap:</b>By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one
        line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with
        this property.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Gap:</b>The gap property defines the size of the gap between the rows
        and between the columns in flexbox, grid or multi-column layout.
